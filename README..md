# 🛡 AXM Cipher – ASCII × Matrix XOR Encryption System

AXM Cipher is a custom-built encryption algorithm that combines:
- ASCII transformation
- Dynamic matrix modulation derived from secret key
- XOR scrambling
- Base64 wrapping for secure storage and transfer

## 🔥 Technology Used
- Python
- Streamlit (Web Interface)

## 🚀 How to Run
1. Install dependencies:
2. Start the web application:

## ⚠ Disclaimer
AXM Cipher is designed purely for academic and research demonstration purposes.
